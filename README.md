In this research work, we propose the use of new auction algorithms for question answering over knowledge graphs.

### Question Answering in knowledge Grraphs using Auction Algorithms

Experiments were conducted on different price and weight settings. The implementation code and run iterations are given in respective notebooks. 
The final results are summarized in results.xls file.

### Datasets Used : KG20C and YAGO3-10
