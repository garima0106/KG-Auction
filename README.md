## Auction Path Construction Algorithm

Reference: [Bertsekas, D.P. New Auction Algorithms for Path Planning, Network Transport, and Reinforcement Learning] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09588).

In this research work, we propose the use of a new auction algorithms for question answering over knowledge graphs for single and multiple destination queries. This method can also answer multi-hop queries and give interpretable explanation. The auction algorithms can adapt to changing environments
in real time, making them suitable for evolving knowledge graphs.

### Question Answering in knowledge Graphs using Auction Algorithms

Experiments were conducted on different price and weight settings. The implementation code and run iterations are given in respective notebooks. 
The final results are summarized in results.xls file.
